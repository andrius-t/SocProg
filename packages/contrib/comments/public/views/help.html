<div class="" data-ng-controller="CommentsController">
  <h1>Example view from your new awesome package</h1>
  <h2>Package: {{package.name}}</h2>
  </br>
  <p class="alert alert-info">
    You can find your package in /packages/contrib/comments.
    This is the first package contribution to MEAN.<br/>

    To include comments for now, you should just include the necessary file<br/>

    For example on -:

    articles/views/view.html or articles/views/list.html <br/>

    After {{article.content}}, insert the folowing
    <pre>
      &lt;div ng-if=&quot;article !== undefined&quot; ng-include=&quot;&#39;comments/views/index.html&#39;&quot; data-ng-controller=&quot;CommentsController&quot; data-ng-init=&quot;findComments(article, 2)&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;!-- Voila, you are done. Were you expecting some more steps? :-) --&gt;
    </pre>
  </p>
